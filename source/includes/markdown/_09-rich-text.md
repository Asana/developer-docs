**Note: In preparation for our [upcoming migration to string IDs](https://community.asana.com/t/new-rich-text-and-mentions/28362) (referred to as `gid`s in the API) this new feature uses only `gid`s and not `id`s. Read more about it in our [community post](https://community.asana.com/t/new-rich-text-and-mentions/28362).**

The web product offers a number of rich formatting features when writing task notes, comments, project descriptions, and project status updates. These features include bold, italic, underlined, and monospaced text, as well as bulleted and numbered lists. Additionally, users can "@-mention" other users, tasks, projects, and many other objects within Asana to create links.

The rich text field name for an object is equivalent to it's plain text field name prefixed with `html_`. The following object types in Asana support rich text:

| Object                 | Plain text field | Rich text field    |
|------------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Tasks                  | `notes`          | `html_notes`       |
| Projects               | `notes`          | `html_notes`       |
| Stories                | `text`           | `html_text`        |
| Project status updates | `text`           | `html_text`        |
| Teams                  | `description`    | `html_description` |

### Reading rich text

> Python

```python
!
from lxml import etree

html_text = "<body>...</body>"
root = etree.HTML(html_text)
user_ids = root.xpath('//a[@data-asana-type="user"]/@data-asana-gid')
for user_id in user_ids:
    print(user_id)
```

> Java

```java
!
import com.jcabi.xml.XML;
import com.jcabi.xml.XMLDocument;
import java.util.List;

XML root = new XMLDocument("<body>...</body>");
List<String> userIds = root.xpath("//a[@data-asana-type=\"user\"]/@data-asana-gid");
for (String userId : userIds) {
    System.out.println(userId);
}
```

> Javascript

```javascript
!
var htmlText = '<body>...</body>'
var parser = new DOMParser()
var doc = parser.parseFromString(htmlText, "text/html")
var iterator = doc.evaluate(
    '//a[@data-asana-type="user"]/@data-asana-gid', doc, null, XPathResult.ORDERED_NODE_ITERATOR_TYPE)
var node = iterator.iterateNext()
while (node) {
    console.log(node.nodeValue);
    node = iterator.iterateNext();
}
```

Rich text in the API is formatted as an HTML fragment, which is wrapped in a root `<body>` tag. Rich text is guaranteed to be valid XML; there will always be a root element, all tags will be closed, balanced, and case-sensitive, and all attribute values will be quoted. The following is a list of all the tags that are currently returned by the API:

| Tag        | Meaning in Asana   |
|------------|--------------------|
| `<body>`   | None               |
| `<strong>` | Bold text          |
| `<em>`     | Italic text        |
| `<u>`      | Underlined text    |
| `<s>`      | Strikethrough text |
| `<code>`   | Monospaced text    |
| `<ol>`     | Ordered list       |
| `<ul>`     | Unordered list     |
| `<li>`     | List item          |
| `<a>`      | Link               |

**Note:** This list can expand as new features are introduced to the Asana web product. Treat rich text as you would treat arbitrary HTML, and ensure that your code doesn't break when it encounters a tag not on this list.

While links are easy to understand when users view the rendered in the Asana web product, an `<a>` tag and its `href` alone are insufficient to programmatically understand what the target of the link is. This is confused further by the fact that the formats of these links are frequently ambiguous. For example, an @-mention to a user generates a link to their "My Tasks", which looks identical to a link to a normal project.

Because of this, the API will return additional attributes in `<a>` tags to convey meaningful information about the target. The following is a complete list of attributes we may return inside an `<a>` tag, in addition to the usual `href`:

| <nobr>Attribute<img width=150/></nobr> | Meaning |
|-------------------------|---------|
| `data-asana-accessible` | Boolean, representing whether or not the linked object is accessible to the current user. If the resource is inaccessible, no other `data-asana-*` attributes will be included in the tag. |
| `data-asana-type`       | The type of the referenced object. One of `user`, `task`, `project`, `tag`, `conversation`, `status_update`, `team`, or `search`. |
| `data-asana-gid`         | The GID of the referenced object. If the referenced object is a user, this is the user's GID.  | 
| `data-asana-project`    | If the type of the referenced object is a task, and the link references that task in a particular project, this is the GID of that project. |
| `data-asana-tag`        | If the type of the referenced object is a task, and the link references that task in a particular tag, this is the GID of that tag. |

Here are some examples of how this behavior manifests:

- Suppose a user with a name of "Tim" and a user GID of `"53421"` is @-mentioned. This will create a link to their "My Tasks" which is a project with a GID of `"56789"`
  - The raw link generated in Asana will be `https://app.asana.com/0/56789/list`.
  - The `<a>` tag returned in the API will be `<a href="https://app.asana.com/0/56789/list" data-asana-accessible="true" data-asana-type="user" data-asana-gid="54321">Tim</a>`.
- Suppose a link to a task with name "Buy milk" and GID `"1234"` being viewed in a project with GID `"5678"` is copied from the address bar and pasted into a comment.
  - The raw link generated in Asana will be `https://app.asana.com/0/5678/1234`.
  - The `<a>` tag returned in the API will be `<a href="https://app.asana.com/0/5678/1234" data-asana-accessible="true" data-asana-type="task" data-asana-gid="1234" data-asana-project="5678">Buy milk</a>`
- Suppose another user @-mentions a project with GID `"5678"` that is private and not visible to you in the web product.
  - The raw link generated in Asana will be `https://app.asana.com/0/5678/list`.
  - The `<a>` tag returned in the API will be `<a href="https://app.asana.com/0/5678/list" data-asana-accessible="false">Private Link</a>`
  
Here's an example of what a complete rich comment might look like in the API:


`
<body>All these new tasks are <em>really</em> getting disorganized, so <a href="https://app.asana.com/0/4168466/list" data-asana-accessible="true" data-asana-type="user" data-asana-gid="4168112">Tim Bizzaro</a> just made the new <a href="https://app.asana.com/0/5732985/list" data-asana-accessible="true" data-asana-type="project" data-asana-gid="5732985">Work Requests</a> project to help keep them organized. <strong>Everyone</strong> should start using the <a href="https://app.asana.com/0/5732985/6489418" data-asana-accessible="true" data-asana-type="task" data-asana-gid="6489418" data-asana-project="5732985">Request template</a> when adding new tasks there.</body>

### Writing rich text

When writing rich text to the API, you must provide similarly structured, valid XML. The text must be wrapped in a `<body>` tag, all tags must be closed, balanced, and match the case of supported tags, and attributes must be quoted. Invalid XML, as well as unsupported tags, will be rejected with a `400 Bad Request` error. Only `<a>` tags support attributes, and any attributes on other tags will be similarly rejected.

For `<a>` tags specifically, to make it easier to create @-mentions through the API, we only require that you provide the GID of the object you wish to reference. If you have access to that object, the API will automatically generate the appropriate `href` and other attributes for you. For example, to create a link to a task with GID `"123"`, you can send the tag `<a data-asana-gid="123"/>` which will then be expanded to `<a href="https://app.asana.com/0/0/123/f" data-asana-accessible="true" data-asana-type="task" data-asana-gid="123">Task Name</a>`. You can also generate a link to a task in a specific project or tag by including a `data-asana-project` or `data-asana-tag` attribute in the `<a>` tag. All other attributes, as well as the contents of the tag, are ignored.

If you do not have access to the referenced object when you try to create a link, the API will not generate an `href` for you, but will instead look for an `href` you provide. This allows you to write back `<a>` tags unmodified even if you do not have access to the resource. If you do not have access to the referenced object and no `href` is provided, your request will be rejected with a `400 Bad Request` error. Similarly, if you provide neither a GID nor a valid `href`, the request will be rejected with the same error.

Here's an example of what you'd send to the API when creating a comment to generate the rich text shown at the end of the previous section:
