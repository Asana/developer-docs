# Platform UI

Platform UI stands for all of the UI components an App can display 
within Asana. There are a few different options available, so 
lets cover them here.
 
## App Widget

An App Widget displays external data within Asana. The contents of a 
widget may change but the overall format stays consistent across apps.
Additionally, these widgets allow users to manually take actions in 
another app.

## App Modal

app from Asana.
