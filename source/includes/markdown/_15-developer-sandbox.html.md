# Developer sandbox

<span class="description">
An Asana developer sandbox is a temporary Asana domain with limited users. In particular, the developer sandbox is a standard Asana account where you can test [Asana Premium](https://asana.com/premium) features during development.
</span>

Developer sandboxes are intended for:

* Developers building or maintaining a third-party integration with Asana (i.e., submit your completed integration to get listed in our [app directory](https://asana.com/apps))
* Existing Asana Premium customers who require a separate environment to perform risk-free testing on the API
