# Developer Sandbox

<span class="description">
An Asana developer sandbox consists of a temporary Asana domain with limited users. It is essentially a standard Asana account where you can test premium features during development.
</span>

#### Developer Sandboxes are intended for:
* Developers building or maintaining a 3rd-party integration with Asana (submit your completed integration to get listed on our apps page)
* Existing premium Asana customers that require a separate environment to perform risk-free testing on the API
