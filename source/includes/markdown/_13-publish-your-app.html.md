# Developer Sandbox

<span class="description">
An Asana developer sandbox consists of a temporary Asana domain with limited users. It is essentially a standard Asana account where you can test premium features during development.
</span>

#### Developer Sandboxes are intended for:
* Developers building or maintaining a 3rd-party integration with Asana (submit your completed integration to get listed on our apps page)
* Existing premium Asana customers that require a separate environment to perform risk-free testing on the API 

To request a developer sandbox, please fill out **[this form](https://form-beta.asana.com?hash=b9bca5d2a3ff59b9a7f82d29086e2d9bcd0df6fd306aa81bd96a63405d5948db&id=1113032351814260)**.

# Submit your App

<span class="description">
Have you built a web application that you want to share with the Asana community? Submit [this form](https://www.asana.com/apps/submit) to get your app listed in the [Asana apps directory](https://www.asana.com/apps).
</span>

### Recommendations and resources for app developers:

* We strongly recommend that you use [OAuth 2.0](/docs/oauth) for your app. Apps that donâ€™t use Auth 2.0 will likely not be approved for listing in our directory.

* Be aware of the [OWASP Top 10 Web App Security Risks](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) when developing your app. 

* If you are new to app security, we recommend reading [The Web Application Hacker's Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/The-Web-Application-Hackers-Handbook/dp/1118026470).

* Use end-to-end encryption. Use a trusted site to test your TLS security (such as: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/).

* Join the [Asana developer community](https://forum.asana.com/c/developersAPI). This is the best resource to get technical questions answered as well as get notified about new API features, deprecations, and other breaking changes. 

* Once your app is listed, you can answer Asana user questions in the [integrations section of the Asana community](https://forum.asana.com/c/integrations).

### Updating your existing app listing
If you wish to update your existing listing, send an email to api-support at asana.com with the specific changes. 

We expect existing apps to maintain the same level of user experience that they had when accepted to the apps directory.
