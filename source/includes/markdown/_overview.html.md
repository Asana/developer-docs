<span class="description">
The Asana API is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/REST" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">REST</a>ful
interface, providing programmatic access to much of the data in the system. It provides predictable URLs for accessing
resources, and uses built-in HTTP features to receive commands and return responses. This makes it easy to communicate
from a wide variety of environments: command-line utilities, gadgets, and even the browser URL bar itself.
</span>

The API accepts <a href="http://json.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSON</a> or form-encoded content in requests and returns
JSON content in all of its responses, including errors. Only
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UTF-8</a> character encoding is
supported for both requests and responses.
