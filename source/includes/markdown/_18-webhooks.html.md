# Overview of Webhooks

Webhooks allow an application to be notified of changes in Asana.

This is similar to our [Events](/docs/asana-events) resource, but webhooks
"push" events via HTTP `POST` rather than expecting integrations to
repeatedly "poll" for them. For services that are already accessible on
the Internet this is often more convenient and efficient.

However, webhooks _require_ a server to be accessible over the internet at
all times to receive the event. For most simple integrations, Events
provide much of the same benefits while using a significantly simpler
implementation which does not require maintaining an internet-accessible
server.

Webhooks and events streams are served from the same infrastructure, where, on
average, events are delivered within a minute of occurring. This system is designed
for at most once delivery, meaning in exceptional circumstances we may fail to deliver
events. Furthermore, webhooks cannot be replayed once delivered. For these reasons, if
your use case requires strong guarantees about processing all changes on a resource and
cannot tolerate any missing events, regardless of how rare that might be, we recommend
building a fallback polling system that fetches the resource periodically as well. Note that,
if your server does not respond to a webhook with a successful HTTP status code within 10 seconds,
Asana will try to resend the webhook for up to 24 hours before giving up.

# Setting Up a Webhook

In order to start receiving webhook events about an Asana resource you will need to establish a webhook connnection and complete the initial handshake. This requires that you create and host an internet accessible webhook server.

The following video tutorial walks you through the process of:

1. Setting up an example webhook server [1:58]
2. Setting up business logic for the [Webhook handshake](/docs/the-webhook-handshake) [3:45]
3. [Establishing a webhook](/docs/establish-a-webhook) on an Asana resource [6:45]
4. Verifying and [Receiving webhook events](/docs/receiving-events)[9:02]

## The Webhook Handshake

In order to ensure that the receiving server is available to receive
incoming events from a webhook Asana will `POST` to the requested target
endpoint during the webhook creation request. In other words, the
outgoing webhook creation request will wait to return until another full
`POST` request from Asana's servers to the target has been completed, _then_ the
webhook creation request can return with a successful response.

_Note: this means that your server must be able to handle being blocked on
the outgoing create request while still being able to receive and handle an
incoming request. A common reason that webhook handshakes fail is that
servers are not able to asynchronously handle the handshake request._

Included in the webhook handshake is a HTTP header called
`X-Hook-Secret`. To successfully complete the handshake the receiving
server should echo back the same header with the same value and a `200 OK` or `204 No Content` response code.

The purpose of this header is to provide a shared secret that both Asana
and the receiving server both store--this is the only time it will be
transmitted. In future webhook events Asana will use this key to compute
a signature over the webhook callback request's body which can be used to
verify that the incoming request was genuine (details below). We strongly
recommend that you take advantage of this security feature and reject
webhooks that have an invalid signature.

</a>

For an example of how this might be implemented in code, see our sample implementation in
[Node.js](https://github.com/Asana/devrel-examples/blob/master/javascript/webhooks-nodejs/index.js#L16-L21)
and [Python](https://github.com/Asana/devrel-examples/blob/master/python/webhooks/webhook_inspector.py#L137-L147)

## Filtering

Webhook events will "propagate up" from contained objects through to
parent objects--for instance, changes to comments will be sent to
webhooks on the parent task and to ones on the task's projects. In this
way a webhook on a project will be notified of all changes that occur in
all of its tasks, subtasks of those tasks, and comments on those tasks
and subtasks.

This can be a lot of data, some of which might not be relevant to a
particular integration, so Asana's webhooks have a filtering feature
which allows integrations to specify only the types of changes that they
care about. By specifying the list of
[WebhookFilter](/docs/tocS_WebhookFilter)s on webhook creation an integration
can select just the subset of events it wants to receive. When filters
are specified on the webhook events will only be delivered if they pass
any of the filters specified when creating the webhook.

To reduce the volume of data to transfer, webhooks created on teams,
portfolios, and workspaces _must_ specify filters. In addition, the set of
event filters that can be placed on a team-level or workspace-level
webhook is more limited than filters for webhooks that are created on
lower-level resources:

- Webhook events from tasks, subtasks, and stories won't be propagated
  to these higher-level webhooks, so all changes on these resources are
  automatically filtered out.
- Webhook events from `project` resources can be filtered for these
  `action`s: `added`, `removed`, `deleted`, `undeleted`, and `changed`.
- Webhook events from `team_membership` resources can be filtered to
  `action`s `added` and `removed`.
- Webhook events from `workspace_membership` resources can be filtered
  to `added` and `removed`.

## Actions

Actions define the type of action that was taken on the resource to trigger
an event for your webhook. When you receive a webhook event, there will be an
associated `action` in the [event](/docs/event) response that indicates the action that triggered
the event. Additionally, actions are used in [webhook filters](/docs/webhook-filter).
You can specify an `action` and a `resource_type` in the `filters` parameter when
[establishing a webhook](/docs/establish-a-webhook) so that you will only receive events matching the action
specified for the resource in your filter. The following are a list of actions
that we support.

- Added - a new resource was created
- Changed - there was a modification made on the resource
- Deleted - the resource itself was deleted
- Removed - the resource was removed from a parent
- Undeleted - the deletion of the resource was undone

## Resources and Actions

Below is a list of resources and actions that can trigger an event for those resources.
This is not an exhaustive list, but should cover the most common use cases.

- Attachment - deleted, undeleted
- Portfolio - added, deleted, removed
- Project - added, changed, deleted, removed, undeleted
- Project Membership - added, removed
- Project Template Configuration - added, deleted, removed
- Project Template Configuration Membership - added, removed
- Section - added, changed, deleted, undeleted
- Story - added, removed, undeleted
- Tag - added, changed, deleted, undeleted
- Task - added, changed, deleted, removed, undeleted
- Team - added, changed, deleted
- Team Membership - added, removed
- Workspace - added, removed, changed
- Workspace Memberships - added, removed

For example, let's say you [establish a webhook](/docs/establish-a-webhook) for an attachement by
providing the GID of an attacment in your `resource` parameter. This means that based on the
resource and action definition for attachment above, a deleted or a undeleted action will trigger
your attachement webhook.

## Example Webhook Servers

The following are example webhook servers that demonstrates the features of Asana webhooks, this includes how to handle the webhook handshake as well as how to receive and verify webhook events.

To try out this demo out for yourself, be sure to generate a new [personal access token](https://developers.asana.com/docs/personal-access-token), then follow the instructions in README.

# Webhook Events

## Receiving Events

Because multiple events often happen in short succession, a webhook
payload is designed to be able to transmit multiple events at once. The
schema of these events is described in [Event](/docs/tocS_Event).

The HTTP POST that the target receives contains:

- An `X-Hook-Signature` header, which allows verifying that the payload
  is genuine. The signature is a SHA256 HMAC signature computed on the
  request body using the shared secret transmitted during the handshake.
  Verification is **strongly recommended**, as it would otherwise be
  possible for an attacker to POST a malicious payload to the same
  endpoint.
- A JSON body with a single key, `events`, containing an array of the
  events that have occurred since the last webhook delivery. (Note that this
  list may be empty, as periodically we send a "heartbeat" webhook to
  verify that the endpoint is still available.)

Note that events are "skinny" and contain only some basic details of the
change, not the whole resource. We expect integrations to make additional
calls to the API to retrieve the latest state from Asana.

## Errors and Retries

If we attempt to send a webhook payload and we receive an error status
code, or the request times out, we will retry delivery with exponential
backoff. In general, if your servers are not available for an hour, you
can expect it to take no longer than approximately an hour after they come
back before the paused delivery resumes. However, if we are unable to
deliver a message for 24 hours the webhook will be deleted.

## Webhook Heartbeat Events

Webhooks keep track of the last time that delivery succeeded, and this time
is updated with each success (i.e `last_success_at`). A delivery succeeds when your
webhook server responds to a webhook event with a `200 OK` or `204 No Content` response code.
To help facilitate this delivery succeeded tracking, webhooks have a “heartbeat” that will deliver an
empty payload to your webhook server at the initial handshake, and then at every eight
hours. This way, even if there is no activity on the resource, the last success time
(i.e `last_success_at`) will still be updated continuously.

Note that if we do not receive a response to a "heartbeat" after 24 hours we will delete that webhook connection.
This means that specific webhook route will not receive future events from Asana. Additionally,
if you make a request for that specific webhook ([GET /webhooks/{webhook_gid}](/docs/get-a-webhook)),
that webhook will no longer be available.

# Webhook Security

In order to receive webhook events, your webhook endpoint needs to be accessible over the internet. As such, because your webhook endpoint is publicly accessible over the internet, it is vulnerable to receiving events that are not from Asana. To ensure that your webhook endpoint receives events from Asana, it is important to verify each request.

Request verification can be done by comparing an HMAC signature generated from the `X-Hook-Secret` and request body to the `X-Hook-Signature`. When you first [establish a webhook](/docs/establish-a-webhook) with Asana, we send your webhook endpoint an `X-Hook-Secret`. Once received, this `X-Hook-Secret` should be stored by your webhook server.

When a webhook event is triggered, Asana sends along a `X-Hook-Signature` in the request header. At this point, your webhook server should extract the body from the request and use it along with the stored `X-Hook-Secret` to generate an HMAC signature. HMAC signatures can be generated using a HMAC library in your language of development and passing in the `X-Hook-Secret` as the secret and the request body as the message. The generated HMAC signature should match the `X-Hook-Signature` sent in the request header. If these signatures differ, it can indicate that the event received was not from Asana.

To read more about our `X-Hook-Signature` see [Receiving Events](/docs/receiving-events)

# Webhook Limits

Webhooks have two different limits

- 1k limit per resource in Asana. (If 10 apps each have 100 webhooks
  watching the same resource, no more webhooks can be placed on the
  webhook. `/events` streams count towards this limit)
- 10k per user-app (An app can have 10k webhooks for EACH user)

# Webhook Troubleshooting

#### Webhook stopped receiving events

This can happen when your registered webhook endpoint ignores incoming heartbeat events. We send periodic heartbeat events to your webhook endpoint every 8 hours to keep track of the last time that delivery succeeded. If we receive no response to heartbeat events after 24 hours we will delete the registered webhook connection. To fix this, you will need to modify your webhook endpoint code to respond to heartbeat events and [re-establish a webhook connection](/docs/establish-a-webhook).

To learn more see about this see [Webhook Heartbeat Events](/docs/webhook-heartbeat-events).

#### Computed webhook signature differs from X-Hook-Signature

When computing your SHA256 HMAC signature, make sure to utilize the `X-Hook-Secret` and the full body of the request. The `X-Hook-Secret` can be found in the header of the initial request sent to your webhook endpoint during the [initial handshake](/docs/the-webhook-handshake) process. The full body of the request should also be used and not a portion of the data inside the request body.

Additionally, check the documentation of the library you are using to compute the SHA256 HMAC signature as it may require you to convert the request body from an object into a string.
