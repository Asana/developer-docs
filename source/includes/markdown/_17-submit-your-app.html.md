# Submit your App

If you've built an application that you wish to share with the Asana community, you can visit the
[developer console](https://app.asana.com/0/my-apps) to begin the app submission process. 

By submitting an app for review, you'll have the opportunity to distribute your app publicly by listing
it in the [app directory](https://asana.com/apps) (as well as in the in-product [app gallery](/docs/installation-flow)
for apps with [App Components](/docs/overview-of-app-components)).

### Submit for review

When managing your app in the [developer console](https://app.asana.com/0/my-apps), select **Submit for review**
in the sidebar to access the app submission form:

From there, you'll review an interactive "pre-flight" checklist of app features before submitting an app. This includes:

- Adding an app icon that uniquely represents your app
- Setting up [OAuth](/docs/oauth) by adding a redirect URL
- Adding app images that show what your app can do
- Adding a short description to summarize what your app can do at a glance
- Adding a longer description (at least 250 characters) to tell users about the features of your app
- Adding information about your company to build trust with users
- Adding a support page URL so that users can seek help
- Adding your app’s privacy policy URL

Along with building or providing the above features, you'll be able to submit additional app details through the submit form,
such as setup instructions, a screencast video link, and other listing details.

### App review process

Once your app has been submitted through the [developer console](https://app.asana.com/0/my-apps), the review process will
begin. At this point, the app will no longer be open for further edits. Note that if your app uses
[App Components](/docs/overview-of-app-components), your submission will go through a security review and QA process
before it’s listed in the in-product [app gallery](/docs/installation-flow).

You can track the status of your app submission on the same **Submit for review** page. If your app submission passes requirements,
you'll receive an email notification that your app is ready to publish. At this point, you can select the **Publish app** button in 
the developer console to share your app:

If your app submission doesn't meet requirements, you will receive an email regarding the next steps (i.e., any changes required)
to get your app ready for re-review.
