# Audit Log Events
 
Asana’s Audit Log API allows you to monitor and act upon critical events in your organization's Asana instance.
 
Only [Service Accounts](https://asana.com/guide/help/premium/service-accounts) in [Enterprise Domains](https://asana.com/enterprise) can access Audit Log API endpoints. Authentication with a Service Account's [Personal Access Token](/docs/personal-access-token) is required.

To get started with the Audit Log API, visit the [API Reference](/docs/audit-log-api).
